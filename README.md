## The best way to figure out if it's snowing in Paris!

There is no more reliable way to know if it's snowing in Paris than to look at ~~Twitter~~ (fuck you Elon) ~~Bluesky~~ (rip public api) actual weather data like a normal person.

After Twitter killed their API and Bluesky decided that searching posts was too mainstream, we had to resort to the boring old method: asking a meteorologist (well, their API).

The script in api/cron runs every 5 minutes and updates https://estcequilneigeaparis.com/
